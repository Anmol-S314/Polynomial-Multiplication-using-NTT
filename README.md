# Polynomial-Multiplication-using-NTT
The outputs have been tested using the Python implementation of NTT by importing sympy. This code takes in two arrays of size which is a power of 2 and returns the multiplied product using Iterative Radix2 NTT and Inverse NTT.
ntt_newfin.c is the final implementation of ntt_new1.c is used to test it against the Python equivalent.
